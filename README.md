# cash-register

## Project Description 📝

Welcome to my project showcasing a fully functional cash register app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app is designed to efficiently calculate and return change to customers based on the price of an item, the amount of cash provided, and the total cash in the register. It features dynamic messaging to guide users through various scenarios, such as insufficient cash provided by the customer or when the cash drawer cannot dispense the correct change.
